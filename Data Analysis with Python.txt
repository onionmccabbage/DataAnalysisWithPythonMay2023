Tuesday
> Welcome: what you know, what you would like to know
> and tech check
  - easist to just install Anaconda 
  - or install Python and the separate tools (Jupyter, Numpy, Pandas etc.)
> Python and related tools for Data Analysis
- Python introduction
> Numpy: arrays and slicing
> Anaconda - adding libraries
> Pandas: series and dataframe
  > import csv and xls (choose which sheet, parse dates)
  > using dates (and slicing)
  > non-numeric indexing
  > combining data
> basics of statistics
> using 'fillna' for missing data (cleaning our data)
> MatplotLib
  - also seaborn and color palette 
    see https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html#palette-tutorial
> review exercise

Wednesday
> brief review so far
> axis and inplace
> data cleaning: more subtle use of techniques
> more about Python: functions and indentation syntax
> Sorting and ranking data
> group and aggregating
> charts: managing, combining and implementing colours ( for a large data set )
> working with large data (large data or big data ?)
> numercial data and stats: descriptive statistics
> review exercise
> other ways to run Python: modules, jupyter notebook and IDE
- provide sample notebooks with more details
