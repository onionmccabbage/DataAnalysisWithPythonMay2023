Review Exercise 3
=================
Choose which of these exercises you would like to work on:
- Databases
- sqlpd
- text read/write
- self-directed exercise
On your own or in groups, work through your chosen exercise, interpreting in whatever way you like
There will be time to complete one of the exercies, but if you like, try others too
There will be an oportunity to share solutions at the end

Databases
---------
Return to the 'students and assistants' notebook.
- make two more tables in the existing database, one for 'students' and one for 'assistants'
  for both tables, use 'Email' as the primary key
- populate these new database tables from the DataFrames
  You will need to loop over the members of the DataFrame and slice the data values
- use SQL to read from both tables, but only where the email values match

Make a new Python Notebook, import pandas and numpy, then read the NBA.csv into a dataFrame
- make a table in the existing database for 'nba' but only use a few columns
  e.g. use Name, Team, College, Age (Name would make a good primary key)
- populate this new table by iterating over the NBA dataFrame

In either case, provide a mechanism to update a member of the database
- e.g. update the Age of NBA players

Using SQLPD
-----------
Return the the 'flights' exercise from yesterday and use sqlpd to analyse the data
- for each analysis we did in Pandas, do the same analysis using sqlpd
- e.g. find the number of airlines, number of unique 'TAIL_NUMBER', maximum delay etc.

Reading and Writing Text
------------------------
In a new Notebook, read in one of the csv or Excel file into a DataFrame
Then choose one or two members of the DataFrame and write them out to a text file (append)
Also provide a mechanism to read back from the text file

General
-------
- If you prefer, choose any data set and carry out your own analysis
- Use pandas, or use sqlpd or use both. The point is for you to work with data analysis
- For example, 'sort' 'rank' or 'filter' the NBA data
