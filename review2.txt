Challenges

- briefly review the data...
- try df.columns (see the column names)
- try df.dtypes (see the column data types)
- Group by 'AIRLINE'
- find the mean DEPATURE_DELAY (also min and max)
- aggregate the min, mean and max DEPATURE_DELAY
- How could you identify the number of unique airlines?
- ... and how many unique aircraft? (TAIL_NUMBER)
- What was the longest departure delay? (interpret how you like)
